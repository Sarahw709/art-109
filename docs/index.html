                    <h3>Life and Death </h3>
                    <p>This piece was an assignment created for a color theory course at Las Positas Community College.
                        Produced digitally on ProCreate, I wanted to experiment with the concept of mortality, and
                        depict life and death through plant cycles. On the left, we see a shriveled, darker-colored
                        plant appearing to be on the brink of dying, contrasted to the brighter-colored plant on the
                        right, which is at the beginning of its life cycle, still growing in its glass enclosure. While
                        these two plants are meant to show the contrast between life and death next to one another, they
                        are also meant to suggest how one state of life can contribute to the other, and how they can go
                        hand in hand. For the background, I wanted to create a somber but peaceful scene to tie into my
                        concept, filled with muted, cool-toned colors, and foggy skies. This also suggests the
                        beautiness and serenity that life can be, even in death. By choosing to focus on plants in order
                        to convey the concept of mortality, I aimed to highlight the quiet durability and inescapable
                        transformation of nature, and how it connects us as humans to all living things.

                    <h3>Marshall Applewhite </h3>
                    <p>This piece was created for an Adobe Illustrator class at Las Positas Community College. The
                        purpose was to practice and become more comfortable with the digital platform, and the prompt
                        was 'cult leaders'. I created this piece on the famous cult leader Marshall Applewhite, who is
                        commonly associated with his strong universal faith, and his belief in UFOs. I utilized
                        Illustrator's pen tool and challenged my own creativity to produce an imaginative depiction of
                        Applewhite, that perfectly encapsulated who he was and what he was known for. By this time, I
                        was already fairly comfortable with my using this platform, but producing this art piece made me
                        more proud of how my skills and confidence were advancing. </p>

                    <h3>Seld-Playing Video Game </h3>
                    <p>For this final project in Art 74, the prompt was to create a short video animation that mimicked
                        a self-playing video game on Adobe After Effects. For my assignment, I wanted to create a very
                        cute and comical cartoon video game. To create the visual design, I utilized Adobe Illustrator's
                        pen tool to make a cute yet simple design. I then exported the design to After Effects, where I
                        animated the image frame by frame. The game consists of two cats fishing for fish on a lake, and
                        the goal is to catch 3 fish that are swimming by. This was one of my first times animating on
                        After Effects, so this was fun yet intimidating to experiment and play around with. Although it
                        took me a long amount of time to animate, and there was much trial and error, I am satisfied and
                        proud of the end result.</p>

                    <h3>Washed Away </h3>
                    <p> This assignment was a project created for a Color Theory course at Las Positas Community
                        College. The prompt was to create an artwork based off of a song, and I chose "Scott Street" by
                        Pheobe Bridgers. To me, this song perfectly encapsulates the feeling of nostalgia, and yearning
                        for a childhood that has been washed away. Additionally, the song talks about the feeling of
                        realizing that you have grown up and moved on from your past, which is a feeling I have been
                        experiencing a lot lately. I created this piece digitally on ProCreate, using a stippling
                        technique to achieve the realistic and textured effect. This assignment was extremeley
                        comforting to me, because it allowed me to both explore my own emotions and create using a
                        medium I love.
